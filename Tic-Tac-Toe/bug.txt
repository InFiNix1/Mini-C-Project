The Bug - Prompt To Take User Input of Type Character

char choice;

printf("Enter Your Choice (y/N): ");
scanf("%c", &choice);


Here, scanf is broken becuase of white spaces in the input buffer of stdin

Even fflush(stdin) has an undefined behaviour, which is a complete no no.

The simple solution is to add a white a white space before reading the char

Solution ---

scanf(" %c", &choice); //Here There is a white space in front of %c which tell scanf to ignore any white spaces before it.
